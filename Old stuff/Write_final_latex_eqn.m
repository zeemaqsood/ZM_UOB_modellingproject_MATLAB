function final_eqn = Write_final_latex_eqn

% Write_final_latex_eqn:
%
% This function will take the eqns from Modeln and will find the equations
% which instruct how much of every variable there can be as there is a
% limited amount of some variables. i.e. in a cell there are always a
% certain number of receptors, whether they are bound to something or not
% they are still counted.
